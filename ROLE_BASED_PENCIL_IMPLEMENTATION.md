# üîê Role-Based Pencil Icon Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented role-based visibility for the pencil (edit) icon in the BuildingsList component. The pencil icon will now only appear for users who have actual scheduling permissions.

## üéØ Implementation Details

### Roles with Pencil Icon Access
The pencil icon (scheduling functionality) is now only visible to:

1. **Admin (5150)** - Full access to all scheduling functions
2. **Technical Planning (1991)** - Access to technical appointment scheduling
3. **HAS Planning (1959)** - Access to HAS appointment scheduling

### Roles WITHOUT Pencil Icon Access
These roles will no longer see the pencil icon as they don't have scheduling permissions:

1. **Technical Inspector (8687)** - Inspection role, no scheduling needed
2. **HAS Monteur (2023)** - Installation role, no scheduling needed  
3. **Werkvoorbereider (1948)** - Work preparation role, no scheduling needed

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Modified Files
- **`/components/RoleBasedLink.js`** - Enhanced with scheduling permission check

### Key Changes Made

1. **Permission Check Logic**:
   ```javascript
   const hasSchedulingPermissions = isAdmin || isTechnischePlanning || isHASPlanning;
   ```

2. **Conditional Rendering**:
   ```javascript
   if (type === 'schedule' && buildingId) {
       if (!hasSchedulingPermissions) {
           return null; // Don't render the pencil icon at all
       }
       // ... routing logic
   }
   ```

3. **Admin Routing Enhancement**:
   - Admin users default to technical scheduling interface
   - Maintains full access to all scheduling functions

## üé® User Experience Impact

### Before Implementation
- All users saw the pencil icon regardless of permissions
- Clicking led to unauthorized access attempts or broken experiences
- Confusing UI for users who couldn't actually use the scheduling function

### After Implementation
- ‚úÖ Only authorized users see the pencil icon
- ‚úÖ Clean, role-appropriate interface for each user type
- ‚úÖ No more confusion about scheduling permissions
- ‚úÖ Better security through UI-level access control

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only see functionality they can use
2. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Fewer UI elements exposed to unauthorized users
3. **Clear Permission Boundaries**: Visual indication of user capabilities
4. **Consistent Authorization**: Aligns UI visibility with backend permissions

## üìã Role-Specific Behavior

### Admin Users
- See pencil icon for scheduling
- Default to technical scheduling interface
- Can access all scheduling functions

### Technical Planning Users
- See pencil icon for scheduling
- Directed to technical appointment scheduler
- Can manage technical appointments only

### HAS Planning Users
- See pencil icon for scheduling
- Directed to HAS appointment scheduler
- Can manage HAS appointments only

### Other Roles (Inspector, Monteur, Werkvoorbereider)
- **No pencil icon visible**
- Clean interface focused on their specific tasks
- No access to scheduling functionality

## ‚úÖ Testing Completed

- ‚úÖ Build compilation successful
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ‚úÖ Proper conditional rendering logic
- ‚úÖ Maintained backward compatibility for all routing

## üéØ Result

The pencil icon now appears **only for users who actually need it**, creating a cleaner, more intuitive interface that respects role-based permissions and reduces confusion for end users.
