## Data Consistency Verification

### ✅ Week Number Calculation
Both frontend and backend use consistent week number calculation:
```javascript
const getWeekNumber = (date) => {
    const firstJan = new Date(date.getFullYear(), 0, 1);
    const days = Math.floor((date - firstJan) / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
    return Math.ceil((date.getDay() + 1 + days) / 7);
};
```

### ✅ Date Formatting
Consistent ISO date formatting across all components:
```javascript
const formatDate = (dateString) => {
    if (!dateString) return '';
    const date = new Date(dateString);
    return date.toISOString().split('T')[0];
};
```

### ✅ Appointment Data Structure
Standard appointment data structure maintained across all components:
```javascript
{
    appointmentBooked: {
        date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
        startTime: "HH:MM",
        endTime: "HH:MM", 
        weekNumber: Number,
        type: "Technical|HAS|Complaint",
        complaintDetails: String // For HAS complaints
    },
    technischeSchouwerName: String, // For technical appointments
    hasMonteurName: String         // For HAS appointments
}
```
